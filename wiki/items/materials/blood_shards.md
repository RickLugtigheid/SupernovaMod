# Blood Shard

**Blood Shard** is a material item used for crafting the carnage armor set and weapons.<br>
A Blood Shard can only be dropped during a [Blood Moon](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Moon) by any non statue-spawned enemies (*i.e. enemies killed after the Blood Moon has ended do not drop it*), with a 1/10 (10%) drop rate.
