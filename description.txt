The Supernova mod is yet another content mod that adds a few new bosses, over a hundred new items, and new NPCs with more content planned in the future.

The mod also adds a new Ring system, where you can add a ring to the so-called ring slot and use a hotkey to activate the rings ability.
After that the ring will need to cool down before it can be used again.

A detailed list of currently added content:
- 3 Bosses
- 105+ items
- 40+ weapons
- 3 rings
- 1 ore
- 10 npcs

Plans:

[version 0.1.8] Boss Rework:
This version will rework the modded bosses, and will add a new mini boss.

[version 0.2] Early Hardmode:
For this version new hardmode items and 1 new boss will be added for early hardmode.
