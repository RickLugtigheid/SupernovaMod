The Supernova mod is yet another content mod that adds a few new bosses, over a hundred new items, and new NPCs with more content planned in the future.

The mod also adds a new Ring system, where you can add a ring to the so-called ring slot and use a hotkey to activate the rings ability.
After that the ring will need to cool down before it can be used again.

[i]Note: this mod does [b]NOT[/b] include the Supernova Mod soundtrack! You will need to download the music mod for the full intended experience![/i]
